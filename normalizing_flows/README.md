# Normalizing Flows (PyTorch)

This section contains from-scratch PyTorch implementations of normalizing flow models for density estimation and generative modeling.

## Implemented / Planned

- ✅ RealNVP
- ⏳ Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF)
- ⏳ Glow

Each model lives in its own subfolder with:
- A full from-scratch PyTorch notebook
- Mathematical explanations
- Training & sampling demos
